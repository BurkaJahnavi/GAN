❖	PREDICTION OF ATTRIBUTE-MISSING DATA IN CORN VARIETY YIELDS VIA GANS	

Overview:

This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to impute missing attribute values in corn yield datasets, enabling more accurate yield predictions in the field of precision agriculture.

Problem Statement:

Real-world agricultural datasets often contain missing information such as:

-Soil moisture

-Humidity

-Sunlight hours

-Crop variety

-Pesticide usage

This project addresses the challenge by using GANs to fill in the missing data intelligently and accurately.

Methodology

->Implemented a GAN model in Google Colab using TensorFlow/Keras.

->Simulated missing attributes in the dataset and trained the model to impute them.

->Evaluated model performance using RMSE and visualized the results.

Technologies Used:

-Google Colab

-Python

-TensorFlow / Keras

-Pandas, NumPy

-Matplotlib / Seaborn

Results:

->Generated high-quality imputations of missing values.

->Outperformed traditional imputation techniques in RMSE evaluation.

->Demonstrated improved data quality for downstream machine learning tasks.

 How to Run:-
 
1)Open the project notebook in Google Colab

2)Make sure required libraries are installed (most are pre-installed in Colab)

3)Upload your dataset or use the provided sample dataset

4)Run each cell sequentially to train and evaluate the model

 No setup required — it's fully cloud-based and runs in Colab.

Future Work:

-Combine with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for yield prediction.

-Extend model to handle different crop datasets and real-time sensor data.
